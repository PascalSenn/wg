# Gra*fast* Working Group Meetings

The Gra*fast* community aims to meet on every fourth Tuesday at 17:00 UTC to
discuss the latest developments in, and any proposed changes to, the Gra*fast*
project. Initially our aim is to improve Gra*fast* in preparation for writing a
specification that can be implemented in many languages.

Attendance to Gra*fast* meetings is open, but all attendees must agree to the
rules outlined in [AGREEMENT.md](./AGREEMENT.md).

To attend a meeting, please add yourself to the relevant meeting file in the
[agendas folder](./agendas/).

If you would like to attend but the meeting time is not convenient for you,
please file an issue to let us know; we'd like to enable as many potential
contributors as possible to attend the meetings.
