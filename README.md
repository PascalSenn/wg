# Gra*fast* Working Group

## About Gra*fast*

Gra*fast* is an exciting new execution engine for GraphQL that enables greater
efficiency across your entire backend stack by leveraging query planning.

The source code for the TypeScript implementation of Gra*fast* is currently in
the `/grafast/grafast` folder of the [Graphile Crystal
monorepo](https://github.com/benjie/crystal/tree/main/grafast/grafast); this enables
faster feedback on changes due to the integration tests of the related
projects. For Gra*fast* version 1.0 we plan to build a specification, and a
reference implementation in a different programming language.

## About the working group

The Gra*fast* working group is a group of people interested in advancing the
Gra*fast* technology for the benefit of all. All contributors must agree
to the terms set out in [AGREEMENT.md](./AGREEMENT.md).

## Join a meeting

If you're interested in contributing to the future of Gra*fast*, consider
joining one of our meetings. See [MEETINGS.md](./MEETINGS.md).
